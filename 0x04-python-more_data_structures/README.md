#0x04. Python - More Data Structures: Set, Dictionary
---
## Description

This project in the low_level_programming series is about:

* Why Python programming is awesome (donâ€™t forget to tweet today, with the hashtag #pythoniscool :))

* What are set and how to use them

* What are the most common methods of set and how to use them

* When to use sets versus lists

* How to iterate into a set

* What are dictionary and how to use them

* When to use dictionaries versus lists or sets

* What is a key in a dictionary

* How to iterate into a dictionary

* What is a lambda function

* What is map, reduce and map functions
